# Tip Jar - Farcaster Miniapp

A lightweight, production-ready Farcaster Miniapp that enables users to send crypto tips seamlessly inside the Farcaster ecosystem. Built for creators, communities, and apps that want simple, fast, onchain value transfer with minimal friction.

## 🚀 Overview

Tip Jar is a Farcaster Miniapp designed to make tipping as easy as reacting to a cast. It integrates onchain payments with an intuitive UI so users can:

- Send small crypto tips to creators or community members

- Support posts directly from within Farcaster

- Track tip transactions transparently onchain

- Plug into any Frame or Farcaster client that supports miniapps

The miniapp is optimized for speed, reliability, and UX simplicity — ideal for creators looking to monetize engagement or communities running reward loops.


## ✨ Features

- One-tap tipping: Simple flow for sending tips directly within Farcaster.

- Miniapp-native UI: Responsive interface optimized for Warpcast & other clients.

- Supports multiple tokens (e.g., USDC, ETH, or any ERC-20 depending on configuration).

- Secure wallet interactions via supported Farcaster wallet integrations.

- Transaction history view (optional, depending on integration).

- Customizable Tip Amounts: Pre-set buttons or user-entered values.

- Developer-friendly setup with clear configuration and environment variables.


## 🧱 Tech Stack

- Farcaster Miniapps SDK (Mini App Studio or custom build)

- Next.js / React (if using a web wrapper)

- Smart contract interactions: Ethers.js / viem

- Hosting: Vercel / Cloudflare / any static host

- Optional: A lightweight Solidity contract if the app manages tipping logic

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/tipjar-miniapp.git
cd tipjar-miniapp


2. Install dependencies:

npm install


3. Create a .env file:

NEXT_PUBLIC_FARCASTER_CLIENT_ID=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPPORTED_TOKENS=...


4. Run the development server:

npm run dev


## 🧪 How It Works
1. User Opens Miniapp

From a cast, link, or embedded frame.

2. Tip Interface Loads

User selects a preset amount or enters a custom value.

3. Wallet Connects

Prompt uses Farcaster-native signing or standard wallet flow.

4. Transaction Executes

Funds are sent directly to the creator’s wallet.

5. Confirmation Screen

Displays status + a link to the transaction explorer.


## 🔗 Smart Contract (Optional)

If the project uses a custom contract:

- Contract name: TipJar

- Purpose: route & record tips

- Events: TipSent(sender, recipient, amount, token)

- Chain: Base / Celo / Polygon / Any EVM network

- (Share your contract if you want an exact section written.)

## 🧭 Roadmap

- Add analytics dashboard

- Add recurring tipping (“subscribe to support”)

- Allow creators to customize their miniapp

- Add NFT or badge rewards for supporters
